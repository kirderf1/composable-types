-- one extensible variant
data Expr e = Const Int

            | Mul (Expr e) (Expr e) 
            | ExprExt (X_ExprExt e)

-- | The extension fields is defined through a type family
type family X_ExprExt e

-- | Undecorated composition of Expr, i.e. with no extension

data UD

-- | The type instance is Void since there is no extension
type instance X_ExprExt UD = Void
